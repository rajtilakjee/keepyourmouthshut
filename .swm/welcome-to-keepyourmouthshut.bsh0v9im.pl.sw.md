<!-- Intro - Do not remove this comment -->
KeepYourMouthShut is an AI-assisted open-source app that provides a 360-degree podcast solution.

It has a developer-first approach for creating entire episodes of podcasts without requiring any expensive equpment or setup. The app takes a number of input from the end-user and based on that generates a script and an audio voice-over file based on that script.
