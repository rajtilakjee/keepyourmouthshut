KeepYourMouthShut is an AI-assisted, 360-degree podcast solution API. It has a developer-first approach for creating entire episodes of podcasts without requiring any expensive equpment or setup. The API takes a number of input from the end-user and based on that generates a script and an audio voice-over file based on that script.
